# 📠 OtterFax

## 🌊 Product Vision

**OtterFax** reimagines faxing through the lens of aquatic friendliness, privacy-forward technology, and nostalgic bureaucracy. Whether you're a coastal non-profit, a maritime lawyer, or just a whimsical soul tired of PDFs pretending to be progress, OtterFax delivers.

> “Because sometimes, the only thing between you and compliance is a highly trained digital otter.”
